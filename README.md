## Exclusive Features

- **Every single GBID, Affix, and SNO string in the game**
- Support for every possible item flag in the game, even though most are unknown, you can toggle them
- Launches and loads saves in a fraction of the time of all other editors, with massively reduced RAM usage
- Developed for editing Switch/PS4 seasonal saves as opposed to editing Xbox 360/PS3 saves for next-gen import (which cannot affect seasons, so please use [D3StudioFast](https://github.com/god-jester/D3StudioFast/releases/latest) for 360/PS3)
	- This allows for my modern approach to truly unlock every transmog, legendary power, frame, pet, and wing set... including ALL SEASONAL PETS, and the Wanderer's Set + Ethereal transmogs with **one click**
- Single executable file, total file count in the zip is 11 files and 2 folders for a total size of ~3.1MB - NOT cluttered with useless files
- The ability to duplicate 1x, 10x, or 50x in one click instead of spamming the old button
- The ability to paste tier quality to selected items, the same as pasting rare name to selection
- Primal Ancient items are marked with an asterisk (*)
- All stashes forcibly change the square_index (item stash slot) from 0-910 (max) for each item, this avoids situations where duping too many items in the editor wouldn't show up in the in-game stash. I ran into this issue with only 148 items in my stash!
- Support for the remaining 8 flags for item properties
 	- These flag effects are unknown, but real gear from in-game spawns with flags 4, 12, 14, and 16 by default
- Still the only editor to handle all the new data in S25 Soul Shards (which, along with Ethereals, can still be used in S26)
 	- Why does this matter? If inserting/modifying legit items or opening a save with S25 Soul Shards, you can actually copy/paste/duplicate them without the constant errors from every other editor, and they will behave properly when leveled up in-game <ins>²</ins>
- Full support for displaying and editing the 8 missing follower item slots, every single item slot in the game is properly handled: 32 total new slots including generic follower slots and Scoundrel/Templar/Enchantress
- Changed "Max All Materials" to "99999999 Materials" so you can still pick up materials in-game, amongst many other UI and quality-of-life improvements exclusive to this release

<ins>²</ins> With this editor, Soul Shards have always leveled up properly and unlocked new Hell Powers (affixes) when upgraded, just like the legit items
