        <h3 id="exclusive-features">Exclusive features found only in this editor:</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Every single GBID (7,206), Affix (7,479), and Rare Name string (60,679) in the game</strong></li>
          <li>Incredible performance: launches and loads saves in a fraction of the time of all other editors, with massively reduced RAM usage</li>
          <li>Instant responsiveness: tasks and threading implemented by GoobyCorp
            <ul>
              <li>When testing the database of 60k strings, another editor took 41 minutes to launch… but v4.2 launches instantly!</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>Support for editing the <strong><ins>Sanctified</ins></strong> item flag, <strong>which only works during Seasonal play</strong>
            <ul>
              <li>Note that you can only have one Sanctified item equipped at a time</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>Sanctified items are marked with a plus (+)</li>
          <li>Primal Ancient items are marked with an asterisk (*)</li>
          <li>Support for toggling every possible item flag in the game</li>
          <li>Able to duplicate 1x, 10x, or 50x in one click instead of spamming the old button</li>
          <li>Able to paste Tier Quality to selected items, exactly like pasting a Rare Name to selected items</li>
          <li>You can edit <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">\db\CurrentSeason.txt</code> if there’s a new season before a new editor release</li>
          <li>Developed for editing Switch/PS4 seasonal saves instead of Xbox 360/PS3 saves like other editors
            <ul>
              <li>This allows for my modern approach to truly unlock every transmog, legendary power, frame, pet, and wing set… including ALL SEASONAL PETS, and the Wanderer’s Set + Ethereal transmogs with <strong>one click</strong></li>
              <li>Old-gen importing cannot affect seasons, so please use <a href="https://github.com/god-jester/D3StudioFast/releases/latest">D3StudioFast</a> for 360/PS3 legacy methods</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>Single executable file, with a total of 2 folders and about 16 files in the ZIP, for a total size of ~4.5MB - NOT cluttered with useless HUGE files like other editors</li>
          <li>The Stash tab used to have items stuck in different slots when importing from the Locker or a Hero File, but now it will correctly force everything into your Stash</li>
          <li>Still the only editor to handle all the new data in S25 Soul Shards (which, along with Ethereals, can still be used in all seasonal play)
            <ul>
              <li>If inserting/modifying legit items or opening a save with S25 Soul Shards, you can actually copy/paste/duplicate them without the constant errors from every other editor, and they will behave properly when leveled up in-game</li>
              <li>With D3Studio Fork, Soul Shards have always leveled up properly and unlocked new Hell Powers (affixes) when upgraded, just like the legit items</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>Full support for displaying and editing the 8 missing follower item slots, every single item slot in the game is properly handled: 32 total new slots including generic follower slots and Scoundrel/Templar/Enchantress</li>
          <li>Changed “Max All Materials” to “99999999 Materials” so you can still pick up materials in-game</li>
          <li><strong>Everything is inside one EXE now</strong></li>
          <li>Added “Seasonal” checkbox next to the “Set 21 Dots/Max Stats” button that will instantly convert your character to and from current season</li>
          <li>Removed the (Seasonal) text from the Sex/HeroCore dropdown; each season seems to rotate the IDs, so it was unreliable</li>
          <li>Made all stashes forcibly and recursively change the item slot from 0-910 (max) for each item, this avoids situations where editing and duping too many items in the editor wouldn’t show up in-game: I ran into this issue with only 148 items in my stash, now <strong>fixed!</strong></li>
          <li>Fixed type conversion for item IDs to what the game expects: <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">unsigned long</code> - this fixes some rare arithmetic errors</li>
          <li>Fixed Blacksmith being set to level 56, correctly goes to 12 now</li>
          <li>Error messages are now more descriptive if there is an issue when launching, previously it would ALWAYS say “Fatal Error: Missing libraries”</li>
          <li>Added a “Max Positive Stats” button on Hero page next to “Set 21 Dots/Max Stats” for Paragon modding, with updated math to be as potent as possible</li>
          <li>Changed cosmetic images and icons, and they no longer stretch/distort. The new size of primary executable is ~4MB</li>
          <li>Changed colors and layout all around the whole tool, and if an item’s prefix is “Jester’s” it has a custom color!</li>
          <li>Lots and lots of improvements to the UI (e.g. layout improvements, fixed typos) and quality-of-life features (easier duplication, pasting rare names, etc.)</li>
        </ul>

          This fork of D3Studio is the fastest and best D3 save/hero editing tool for <b>PS4 (Playstation 4), Nintendo Switch (including Yuzu), and PS5 (Playstation 5)</b> in 2023. This application was made for <b>Diablo III: Reaper of Souls (RoS) and Eternal Collection.</b> It will work with <b>Diablo 3 Vanilla for PS3 (Playstation 3) and Xbox 360,</b> but it is not ideal.

          D3StudioFork is also known as D3Studio Fork and D3 Studio Fork: a save modding tool based on D3Studio. It supercedes D3RoSEdit and DIIIROS.SaveEdit (DIII Save Editor) with more and better features. It will not work with Xbox One/Series X|S until a method is discovered to decrypt and edit game saves. Not compatible with the PC version of Diablo 3!
